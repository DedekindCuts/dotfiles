use work VS code settings
    add instructions to bootstrap file to symlink settings folder and install extensions
        ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User
            snippets
            keybindings.json
            settings.json
        ~/.vscode
            extensions (just install these; don't copy the folder)
                code --list-extensions > <repo>/.vscode-settings/extensions-list.txt
                <repo>/.vscode-settings/extensions-list.txt | xargs -L 1 code-insiders --install-extension

add brewfile, bootstrap file, etc.

plan:
    bootstrap
        ask whether work or home computer; set class accordingly
        download and install things and apply in correct order


look into adding ssh key(s) (with encryption - only to private repo)

add .veracitydata (?) (for backup reasons)

change VS Code default shell arguments to not run login shell (and therefore not change path) (?)

macos
  look over again to confirm desired settings changes
  see if any might need to be different on different machines
