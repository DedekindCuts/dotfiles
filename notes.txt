Notes

look into adding ssh key(s) (with encryption - only to private repo)
consider not including r and python in personal Brewfile (test to see if there are any conflicts with conda installed)
consider just putting conda init code at the end of .bash_profile (see if it causes any problems on a machine without conda)
make public and private versions of dotfiles
get snippets from Sublime folder and add to VS Code
keep Sublime settings in Dropbox instead of this repo (?)
cite https://github.com/DoomHammer/dotfiles
    dircolors
    gitconfig
    shell-aliases
    shell-common
improve README, citations, etc.
more ideas: https://github.com/dotphiles/dotphiles, yadm dotfiles list

WORKFLOW

download yadm (using git clone? or however possible)
set yadm class
    yadm config local.class Personal
    yadm config local.class Veracity
    etc.
yadm clone this repo; yadm *should* take care of the rest

LATER

look into using Brew cask on Veracity computer

command for getting list of VS Code installed extensions:
    code --list-extensions > <repo>/.vscode-settings/extensions-list.txt

figure out virtualenv (for more than Python?)
    if not as good, consider using Homebrew + Conda (look for conflicts)
        Homebrew for cask and for general-use packages (GNU tools, etc.)
        Conda for package management between projects

(later) make sure this is all user-specific, not system-wide (as much as possible)
    most likely conflict is .macos
(later) create separate "one-and-done" script to install yadm and apply dotfiles (for a new machine)
    install yadm (with git? or however possible)
    need to set yadm class after installing yadm but before cloning dotfiles repo
        yadm config local.class Personal
        yadm config local.class Veracity

look for Firefox options for .macos

(later) find out if there is a way to get a notification when the repo is dirty and needs to be pushed

(later) change VS Code default shell arguments to not run login shell (and therefore not change path) (?)

Programs unavailable through Homebrew, Cask, MAS:
Audacity
antivirus (Sophos, AVG)?
